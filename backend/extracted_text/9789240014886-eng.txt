Regular physical activity can prevent and help manage heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and cancer which cause nearly three quarters of deaths worldwide. Physical activity can also reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, and enhance thinking, learning, and overall well-being. 2 Any amount of physical activity is better than none, and more is better. For health and wellbeing, WHO recommends at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week (or the equivalent vigorous activity) for all adults, and an average of 60 minutes of moderate aerobic physical activity per day for children and adolescents. 3 All physical activity counts. Physical activity can be done as part of work, sport and leisure or transport (walking, wheeling and cycling), as well as every day and household tasks. 4 Muscle strengthening benefits everyone. Older adults (aged 65 years and older) should add physical activities which emphasize balance and coordination, as well as muscle strengthening, to help prevent falls and improve health. 5 Too much sedentary behaviour can be unhealthy. It can increase the risk of heart disease, cancer, and type-2 diabetes. Limiting sedentary time and being physically active is good for health. 6 Everyone can benefit from increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour, including pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. Four to five million deaths per year could be averted if the global population was more physically active. These global guidelines enable countries to develop evidence-based national health policies and support the implementation of the WHO Global action plan on physical activity 2018-2030. Action and investment in policies to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour can help to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Good Health and Wellbeing (SDG3), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), Climate Action (SDG13), as well as Quality Education (SDG4) among others. EVERY MOVE COUNTS Moderate-intensity activity will raise your heart rate, and make you breathe faster. Vigorous-intensity activity makes you breathe hard and fast. There are many ways you can strengthen your muscles, whether you’re at home or in a gym. iv Key messages 1 ECITCARP DOOG STNEMETATS INTRODUCTION DEVELOPMENT PROCESS Regular physical activity is a key protective factor for The guidelines were prepared in accordance with the prevention and management of noncommunicable the WHO handbook for guideline development (4).

Strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence Vigorous-intensity aerobic activities, as well as those that strengthen muscle and bone, should be incorporated at least 3 days a week. Strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence • Doing some physical activity is better than doing none. • If children and adolescents are not meeting the recommendations, doing some physical activity will benefit their health. • Children and adolescents should start by doing small amounts of physical activity, and gradually increase the frequency, intensity and duration over time. • It is important to provide all children and adolescents with safe and equitable opportunities, and encouragement, to participate in physical activities that are enjoyable, offer variety, and are appropriate for their age and ability. ECITCARP DOOG STNEMETATS In children and adolescents, physical activity confers benefits for the following health outcomes: improved physical fitness (cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness), cardiometabolic health (blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, glucose, and insulin resistance), bone health, cognitive outcomes (academic performance, executive function), mental health (reduced symptoms of depression); and reduced adiposity. At least 60 minutes a day moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity across the week; most of this physical activity On at least should be aerobic. 3 days a week vigorous-intensity aerobic activities, as well as those that strengthen muscle and bone should be incorporated.
