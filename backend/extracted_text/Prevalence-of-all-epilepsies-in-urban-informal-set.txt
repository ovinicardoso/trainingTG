This gives confidence in the robustness of Africa, the prevalence of epilepsy in Nairobi is twice as the estimates reported. The cases were detected using high as that reported in a metropolitan area of Enugu in screening tools with a high sensitivity, thus enabling Nigeria (6·0 cases per 1000 people)3 and slightly lower the detection of nearly all types of epilepsy. We than what was reported from a study in a Senegalese peri- incorporated four questions in the questionnaire to urban district (14·2 cases per 1000 people).4 The Nigerian detect non-convulsive epilepsy. Difficulty in detecting study excluded children, a group in which epilepsy is non-convulsive epilepsy in epidemiological studies is common. When we compare similar age groups between documented,9,10 but our findings suggest that it is possible the Nigerian study and ours, our prevalence estimate was to detect these cases reliably. Another strength is that we still higher.3 This is probably because we assessed all used a population-based approach, which ensured that types of epilepsy by adding specific questions to detect residents were all approached for screening. non-convulsive epilepsy, which might have been missed However, there were limitations.

The specificity of 2013, which reported an adjusted prevalence ranging the screening questionnaire was low. However, this did from 7·0 cases to 14·8 cases per 1000 people.8 This not affect our prevalence estimates because the interest prevalence range is higher than that reported in rural was in detecting all true positives, which was addressed by Zambia in 2004.19 Those studies8 implemented a similar accounting for the tool’s sensitivity.

One limitation is that being a cross-sectional informal settlements but did not collect sufficient data to study, most of these findings (apart from age-related determine what could explain the difference. Future work findings) might result from stigma-related reverse might consider qualitative data to explore factors causality.
