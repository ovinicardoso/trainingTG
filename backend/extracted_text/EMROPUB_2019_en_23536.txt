But the increased consumption of processed food, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats and free sugars or salt/sodium, and many do not eat enough fibre-rich fruits, vegetables and whole grains. 7 Key facts A healthy diet helps protect against malnutrition and diet-related noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. Adopt healthy dietary practices: • balance calories in with calories out • limit fat intake • shift from saturated to unsaturated fats • eliminate industrially-produced trans fats • limit sugars and salt intake BEAT MALNUTRITION AND NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES A healthy diet helps protect against malnutrition in all its forms, as well as diet-related noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. GLOBAL RISKS Unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are leading global risks to health. START EARLY IN LIFE Healthy dietary practices start early in life – breastfeeding fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development, and may have longer- term health benefits like reducing the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing noncommunicable diseases later in life. 8 BALANCE CALORIES Energy intake (calories) should be in balance with energy expenditure. LIMIT FAT INTAKE Evidence indicates that total fat should not exceed 30% of total energy intake to avoid unhealthy weight gain (1,2,3), with a shift in fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated fats (3), and towards the elimination of industrially-produced trans fats (4). LIMIT SUGAR INTAKE Limiting intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake (2,5) is part of a healthy diet. A further reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake is suggested for additional health benefits (5). LIMIT SALT INTAKE Keeping salt intake to less than 5 g per day helps prevent hypertension and reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke in the adult population (6). 2025 GOALS WHO Member States have agreed to reduce the global population’s intake of salt by 30% and halt the rise in diabetes and obesity in adults and adolescents as well as in childhood overweight by 2025 (7,8,9). 9 Healthy diet for adults Fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains. 10 Eat fruits, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat, brown rice) every day. The recommended daily intake for an adult includes: 2 cups of fruit (4 servings), 2.5 cups of vegetables (5 servings), 180 g of grains, and 160 g of meat and beans. Red meat can be eaten 1−2 times per week, and poultry 2−3 times per week. 5 Eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a portions day (at least 400 g) (2). Potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots are not classified as fruit or vegetables. max 12 Limit total energy intake from free sugars to around 12 level teaspoons (which is equivalent to 50 g), but ideally less than 5% of total energy intake for additional health benefits (5). Most free sugars are added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and can also be found in sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Limit total energy intake from fats to less than 30% (1,2,3). Unsaturated fats (e.g. found in fish, avocado, nuts, sunflower, canola and olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (e.g. found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard) (3). Industrially-produced trans fats (found in processed food, fast food, snack food, fried food, frozen pizza, pies, cookies, margarines and spreads) are not part of a healthy diet. Limit salt to less than 5 g per day (equivalent to approximately 1 teaspoon) (6) and use iodized salt. 11 Healthy diet for infants and young children 12 In the first 2 years of a child’s life, optimal nutrition fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development. It also reduces the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing noncommunicable diseases later in life. Advice on a healthy diet for infants and children is similar to that for adults, but the following elements are unique to infants and children. Infants should be breastfed exclusively during the first 6 months of life. Infants should be breastfed continuously until 2 years of age and beyond. From 6 months of age, breast milk should be complemented with a variety of adequate, safe and nutrient-dense complementary foods. Salt and sugars should not be added to complementary foods. 13 Practical advice on maintaining a healthy diet Fruits and vegetables Eating at least 400 g, or 5 portions, of fruits and vegetables per day reduces the risk of noncommunicable diseases (2), and helps ensure an adequate daily intake of dietary fibre. To improve your fruit and vegetable consumption you can: • always include vegetables in your meals • eat fresh fruits and raw vegetables as snacks • eat fresh fruits and vegetables in season • eat a variety of choices of fruits and vegetables. Fats Reducing the amount of total fat intake to less than 30% of total energy intake helps prevent unhealthy weight gain in the adult population (1,2,3). Also, the risk of developing noncommunicable diseases is lowered by reducing saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake, and total trans fats to less than 1% of total energy intake, and replacing both with unsaturated fats (2,3). 14 Fats intake can be reduced by: Some food manufacturers are reformulating recipes to reduce the salt • changing how you cook – remove the content of their products, and it is helpful fatty part of meat; use vegetable oil to check food labels to see how much (not animal oil); and boil, steam or bake sodium is in a product before purchasing rather than fry or consuming it. • avoiding processed foods containing Potassium, which can mitigate the trans fats negative effects of elevated sodium • limiting the consumption of foods consumption on blood pressure, can be containing high amounts of saturated increased through consumption of fresh fats (e.g. cheese, ice cream, fatty meat). fruits and vegetables. Salt, sodium and Sugars potassium The intake of free sugars should Most people be reduced throughout the consume too much lifecourse (5). Evidence indicates sodium through salt that in both adults and children, (corresponding to the intake of free sugars should an average of 9–12 g of be reduced to less than 10% of salt per day) and not enough total energy intake (2,5), and that a potassium. High salt consumption and reduction to less than 5% of total energy insufficient potassium intake (less than intake provides additional health benefits 3.5 g) contribute to high blood pressure, (5). Free sugars are all sugars added to which in turn increases the risk of heart foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook disease and stroke (6,10). or consumer, as well as sugars naturally 1.7 million deaths could be prevented each present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and year if people’s salt consumption were fruit juice concentrates. reduced to the recommended level of less Consuming free sugars increases the than 5 g per day (11). risk of dental caries (tooth decay). Excess People are often unaware of the amount calories from foods and drinks high in of salt they consume. In many countries, free sugars also contribute to unhealthy most salt comes from processed foods weight gain, which can lead to overweight (e.g. ready meals; processed meats like and obesity. bacon, ham and salami; cheese and salty snacks) or from food consumed frequently Sugar intake can be reduced by: in large amounts (e.g. bread). Salt is also added to food during cooking (e.g. bouillon, • limiting the consumption of foods stock cubes, soy sauce and fish sauce) or and drinks containing high amounts at the table (e.g. table salt). of sugars (e.g. sugar-sweetened beverages, sugary snacks and candies) You can reduce salt consumption by: • eating fresh fruits and raw vegetables as snacks instead of sugary snacks. • not adding salt, soy sauce or fish sauce during the preparation of food • not having salt on the table • limiting the consumption of salty snacks • choosing products with lower sodium content. 15 How to promote healthy diet Diet evolves over time, being influenced by many factors and complex interactions. Income, food prices (which will affect the availability and affordability of healthy foods), individual preferences and beliefs, cultural traditions, as well as geographical, environmental, social and economic factors all interact in a complex manner to shape individual dietary patterns. Therefore, promoting a healthy food environment, which promotes a diversified, balanced and healthy diet, requires involvement across multiple sectors and stakeholders, including government and the private sector, while safeguarding public health against vested interests. Governments have a central role in creating a healthy food environment that enables people to adopt and maintain healthy dietary practices. 16 Effective actions by policy-makers to create a healthy food environment include: Creating coherence in Encouraging consumer national policies and demand for healthy foods and investment plans including meals: trade, food and agricultural policies to promote a healthy diet • promote consumer awareness of a healthy and protect public health: diet • develop school policies, standards and • increase incentives for producers to grow programmes that encourage children to and retailers to use and sell fresh fruits adopt and maintain a healthy diet and vegetables • educate children, adolescents and adults • reduce incentives for the food industry about nutrition and healthy dietary practices to continue or increase production • encourage culinary skills, including in of processed foods with industrially- schools produced trans fats, saturated fats and free sugars • support point-of-sale information, including through nutrition labelling that ensures • encourage reformulation of food products accurate, standardized and comprehensible to reduce the contents of salt, fats (i.e. information on nutrient contents in saturated fats and trans fats) and free food in line with the Codex Alimentarius sugars Commission guidelines • implement WHO's recommendations on • provide nutrition and dietary counselling at the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic primary health care facilities. beverages to children • establish standards to foster healthy Promoting appropriate infant dietary practices through ensuring and young child feeding the availability of healthy, safe practices: and affordable food in pre-schools, schools, other public institutions, and in the workplace • implement the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and • explore regulatory and voluntary subsequent relevant World Health Assembly instruments, such as marketing and food resolutions, as well as WHO's guidance on labelling policies, economic incentives or ending the inappropriate promotion of foods disincentives (i.e. taxation, subsidies), to for infants and young children promote a healthy diet • implement policies and practices to promote • encourage transnational, national and protection of working mothers local food services and catering outlets to improve the nutritional quality of • promote, protect and support breastfeeding their food, ensure the availability and in health services and the community, affordability of healthy choices, and including through the Baby-friendly Hospital review portion size.
