Therefore, Strain and countries (4%) with high-income countries (28%).10 It is colleagues2 correctly predict that the global target4 therefore no surprise that the recent publication using of a 15·0% relative reduction in physical inactivity data from 163 countries2 found that the prevalence between 2010 and 2030 is unlikely to be met.

Furthermore, the 2020 publication by Strain and The estimates presented by Strain and colleagues2 colleagues analysing the domains of physical activity10 consider overall physical activity, including activities practiced in different domains of life: leisure, travel, Strenuous activity (child labour) Strenuous activity (prolonged standing) work, and household. By adding these activities into a single physical activity score, relevant information about the purpose and context of physical activity might be missed. In terms of purpose, it is essential to differentiate physical activity practiced by necessity from physical activity practice by choice.5 Many forms of child labour; underpaid, unsafe, and unhealthy jobs; and modern day slavery6 typically result in high levels of energy expenditure, for example, involving prolonged Strenuous activity (pulling) Strenuous activity (lifting) periods of walking, standing, or strenuous weightlifting or pulling (figure).7 Even physical activity for transport, which has numerous individual and environmental benefits5—particularly in low-income and middle- income countries and in low-income populations from high-income countries—is more a necessity than a choice. Therefore, as outlined by Piggin and colleagues,8 it is imperative to assess whether some forms of Figure: Examples of work and household physical activity globally: does every move really count towards physical activity are congruent with the dignity, cultural better health? www.thelancet.com/lancetgh Vol 12 August 2024 e1215 Comment showed that two-thirds of overall physical activity in *Andrea Ramirez Varela, Pedro C Hallal Malawi takes place in the work and household domain. andrea.ramirezvarela@uth.tmc.edu We urge the field to consider the purpose and context Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health (ARV), Department of Pediatrics, McGovern Medical School (ARV), and Center for Pediatric Population in which physical activity is practiced in each community.
