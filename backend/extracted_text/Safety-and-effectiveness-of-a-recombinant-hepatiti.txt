The effect of clustering was accounted for by using a generalised estimating equations approach. OR=odds ratio. *Due to within-cluster dependencies, the crude OR is not equivalent to odds among participants in the HEV239 group relative to odds among participants in the control group. †Adjusted for age, BMI, and number of doses. ‡Pregnancy, puerperium, and neonatal disorders, and the listed subcategories, are presented for the 5011 women who became pregnant within 2 years of receiving their last vaccine dose; as each participant could have had multiple pregnancies and thus multiple pregnancy outcomes, the numbers can exceed the total number of pregnancy, puerperium, and neonatal disorders. §Includes four cases of congenital anomalies in the control group (two of which resulted in elective terminations and two were discovered after birth [sick newborn]); this category thus overlaps with the other subcategories above.
