Childhood diabetes more effectively than MICT (Costigan et al., 2015; obesity is highly prevalent; the latest epidemiological studies Hannanetal.,2018).Wewegeetal.(2017)showedthatHIITcan demonstratedthat107.7millionchildrenworldwidewereobese save40%ofthetimecommittedtoMICT,withsimilarmagnitude in 2015 and that the growth rate of childhood obesity was changesinbodyfatandwaistcircumference(WC). greater than that of adult obesity (Afshin et al., 2017). Strong HIIT studies have focused more on adults and patients evidence indicates that excess weight during childhood is a with chronic disease than on obese children and adolescents. predictor of future obesity and can increase cardiometabolic Moreover, there is no consensus or indication as to whether risks, such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, HIIT is superior or a good alternative training modality and poor cardiorespiratory fitness, in obese children (Gepstein to MICT for reducing the cardiometabolic risk factors in and Weiss, 2019; Wibaek et al., 2019). Emerging evidence also childhood obesity.
