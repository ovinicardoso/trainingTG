The strategy involves consuming protein inand around a training session in aneffort to facilitate muscular repair and remodeling, and thereby enhance post-exercise strength- and hypertrophy-related adaptations. Despite theappar- entbiological plausibility ofthe strategy, however,the effectiveness of protein timing inchronic training studies has been decidedly mixed.The purpose of this paper therefore was to conducta multi-level meta-regression ofran- domized controlled trials to determine whether protein timing is a viable strategy for enhancing post-exercise mus- cular adaptations.The strength analysis comprised478 subjects and 96 ESs, nested within 41 treatment or control groups and 20 studies. The hypertrophy analysis comprised 525 subjects and 132 ESs, nested with 47 treatment or control groups and 23 studies. Asimplepooled analysis ofprotein timing without controllingfor covariates showed a small to moderate effect onmuscle hypertrophy with no significant effect found onmuscle strength. In the full meta-regression model controlling for all covariates, however, no significant differences were found between treat- ment and control for strength or hypertrophy. The reduced model was not significantly different from the full model for either strength or hypertrophy. With respect to hypertrophy, total protein intake was the strongest pre- dictor of ESmagnitude.These results refute thecommonly held belief that thetiming ofprotein intake inand around a training session is critical to muscular adaptations and indicatethatconsuming adequate protein incom- bination withresistance exercise is the key factor for maximizing muscle protein accretion.
