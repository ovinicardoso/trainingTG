Interestingly, BMI has a contrasting relationship with the types preterm-nonSGA and term-SGA newborns. With increasing BMI, risk of term-SGA decreases whereas that of preterm-nonSGA increases. This finding emphasises that SVN is biologically heterogeneous; nutritional interventions to reduce SVN should be cautiously designed and go beyond just dietary supplementation. A well designed package of health, nutrition, psychosocial care, and water and sanitation and hygiene interventions delivered during precon- ception and pregnancy has shown to improve maternal outcomes and reduce the risk of low birthweight.17 Delivery of such interventions must be scaled up in LMICs.

Although SVN are susceptible to to correct this dysbiosis, thereby reducing the incidence adverse clinical outcomes, some risk factors are specific of preterm-SGA births. Further, we identified risk factors for either preterm birth or SGA. For example, cervical for specific SVN types across trimesters—namely, length, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal bleeding are risk biomass fuel, jaundice, and symptoms suggestive of factors that are associated with the preterm birth types of urinary tract infection. Notably, biomass fuel and urinary SVN. Interventions targeted against these factors will tract infection have been previously reported as risk reduce the incidence of the specific types.

There is an urgent need for accurate risk- study. The study was based in a secondary-level care stratification tools to enable efficient delivery targeted to district hospital and not at the community level. However, those who are at risk of SVN. Such prediction tools can the inferences are representative of the population in the be developed by integrating clinical, molecular, and region as this hospital assumes the role of a primary-care imaging sciences.7,28 We have discovered novel molecular centre when it caters to pregnant individuals. Another markers that can be combined with clinical and imaging important limitation is that the study was conducted in predictors to accurately stratify pregnant individuals at a single north Indian centre. Similar analyses from other risk of preterm birth.29,30 Such an approach can be adopted regions within India and south Asia are needed to for SVN. improve the generalisability of our findings. The major strength and novelty of our study is the In conclusion, we identified crucial trimester-specific comprehensive evaluation of overall and trimester- risk factors for SVN and its types based on their effect specific risk factors from a rigorously followed prospective sizes and attributable fractions to be able to prioritise cohort analysed using robust methods. We used interventions. Addressing preconception and antenatal population attributable fraction to identify risk factors maternal undernutrition; communicating the risks of that need urgent intervention. Further, the accurate short time periods between pregnancies; and preventing estimation of gestational age using ultrasound (done in and managing pre-eclampsia, bacterial vaginosis, and either the first trimester or early second trimester) adds to urinary tract infections are priority areas for public health the reliability of our outcomes. Importantly, the recent interventions for SVN. These interventions should be Lancet series3–6 highlighted data scarcity from south Asia complemented with use of risk-stratification tools. Such a compared with other regions, and our study significantly concerted effort will improve care for the most vulnerable contributes to filling this gap.
