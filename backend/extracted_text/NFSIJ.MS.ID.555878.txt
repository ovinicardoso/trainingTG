With the advancement of science, emerging research proves that high loads are indeed hypertrophic, but low loads can also be hypertrophic at similar levels when there is an assessment of the load volume (sets x repetitions x weight) of the training. This communication presents recent articles that used this theme to demonstrate that low loads can be well used when the purpose is muscle hypertrophy aiming at an increase in the load volume of the training. Abbreviations: 1RM: One Maximum Repetition; RT: Resistance Training Introduction Methods The neuromuscular adaptations caused manipulation of RT (Resistance Training) variables, such as volume, intensity, The present systematic bibliographic review is based on frequency of training, rest interval, selection and order of existing evidence on the volume load and muscle hypertrophy exercises, velocity of execution, muscular actions, and range of when low loads were used. The literature search was conducted motion, can be used to improve muscle hypertrophy. A simple independently and separately by the author in the electronic method to quantify training volume if all the other variables PubMed database up to the 20th of December 2024. The search are kept constant would be the volume load, the total amount was performed using a Boolean search strategy (operators “AND” of load worked in the training sessions [1], this method use a and “OR”) and a combination of the following keywords: (“low mathematical product of the sets, repetitions and weights used load” OR “load” OR “volume load” OR “muscle hypertrophy” OR in resistance training. Knowing that, previous studies have “hypertrophy” OR “muscle”) AND (“hypertrophy load” OR “muscle shown that a moderate (5-9 sets per muscle group) to high (10 architecture” OR “cross sectional area” OR “muscle volume” sets per muscle group) weekly training volume is indicated to OR “muscle circumference”) AND (“adolescent” OR “adult” OR induce muscle growth as compared to lower training volume (5 “young adult” OR “older Adults” OR “aged” OR “seniors” OR sets per muscle group) [2], implying that training volume can be “elderly”) AND (“controlled trial” OR “randomized controlled an effective variable to induce muscle hypertrophy. But what if trial”). These keywords were identified using literature searches, there was a comparison between training loads, using high and expert opinion, and a controlled vocabulary (e.g., Medical low loads, does volume load remain relevant? Thinking about Subject Headings [MeSH]). Inclusion criteria for eligible studies these questions about the loads used in RT and their results on were defined according to the PICOS (Population, Intervention, muscle hypertrophy, gaps arise that could be better elucidated, Comparison, Outcome, Study Design) approach [3]. The following such as: are high loads always more hypertrophic than low loads? criteria were defined: (1) Population: healthy participants without The objective of this letter is to bring a discussion about the restriction regarding age, sex, or training status, (2) Intervention: importance of volume load in RT correlating it with high and low SS interventions with a minimum duration of two weeks, (3) loads for results on muscle hypertrophy.

Twenty-seven cadets were allocated to either a study design: (randomized) control trials with measurements at high-load group (HL; n=14, 10RM) or a low-load group (LL; n=13, baseline and after completion of the intervention (within and/or 30RM). The training protocol consisted of 3 sets of 7 exercises per bReetswueletns subjects). session, performed 2 days a week during the first 10 weeks and 3 days a week during the last 9 weeks. The volume load was 13,687 (12,324 - 15,049) kg to HL group and 25,119 (23,720 - 26,518) kg The primary search resulted in 1849 references. Of this LL group. The mean total lean mass among men increased from number of search results, a total of 50 full-text papers were read, 60.2 kg to 62.8 kg (difference of 2.6 kg) in the LL group, while in and 6 studies, with a total of 12 study groups were included in the HL group it was from 57.7 to 59.7 (difference of 2 kg) [9]. The the review. Secondary search resulted in another 3131 results; main study findings were as follows: (a) a volume load using 20% however, no additional studies were included. The training or 30% 1RM appears to influence muscle hypertrophy to the same program in the included studies lasted from 8 to 22 weeks. In all extent as 80% 1RM and (b) high-load (80% 1RM) may be superior studies, muscle biopsy samples were taken from the quadriceps in strength generation when compared to low-load (20% or 30% mDuisscclue.ssion 1RM). When compared to 20% 1RM com 40%, 60%, and 80% 1RM, the results demonstrated that the intensities ranging from 20% to 80% 1RM are effective for increasing muscle strength and Twenty-seven participants were randomized in 3 experimental hypertrophy. At this study, the 20%1RM group did on average groups to be performed 16 weekly sets per muscle group for a 67 repetitions compared to 28 repetitions, 14 repetitions and group (G16, n=9), or 24 weekly sets for others (G24, n=9), or 32 10 repetitions for the 40%1RM, 60%1RM and 80%1RM groups, weekly sets per muscle group for another (G32, n=9). At the study, respectively.

In another paper, thirty health young men were muscle hypertrophy when are applied low loads. The study that selected within-subject design, in which one leg and arm trained selected cadets (men and women) to a high-load group (10RM) or at 20% 1RM (G20; n=30) and the contralateral limb was randomly a low-load group (30RM), obtained 13,687 kg volume load to HL assigned to one of the three conditions: 40% (G40; n=10); 60% group and ~25,119 kg to LL group. A difference in volume load is (G60; n=10), and 80% 1RM (G80; n=10), respectively. In summary, noted for the low load group. Perhaps, this could be the important this study demonstrated that both intensities were effective for point for muscle hypertrophy, since the group LL increased the increasing muscle strength and hypertrophy [5]. Twenty-three mean total lean mass 60.2 kg to 62.8 kg (+2.6 kg) and the HL untrained women were selected for a RT to failure intervention group increased 57.7 to 59.7 (+2 kg) [9]. Another study divided at either 30% 1RM (n=11) “low load” or 80% 1RM (n=12) “high participants between low load (30% 1RM) and high load (80% load”. During weeks 2–7, the subjects completed 2 sets to failure 1RM) and finding that the resistance training to failure at low for each exercise and 3 sets during weeks 8–11. The results of this (30% 1RM) and high (80% 1RM) loads are effective for increasing study demonstrated RT failure at low (30% 1RM) and high (80% 1RM strength [6].
