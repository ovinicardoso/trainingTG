Results: Intraset velocity loss was lower in ACT compared with the PAS protocol, without statistically significant differences (P=.571).BloodlactateconcentrationsincreasedacrossthesessionforbothISRprotocols,butthisincreasewasdiminishedinACT compared with PAS, without statistical meaning (P>.05). Conclusions: Continuing to perform the same activation during rest intervals was well-tolerated and may reduce the loss of performance due to accumulated workload throughout an RT session, suggesting that ACT may trigger a metabolic advantage in exercise performance for consecutive sets during an RT bout.
