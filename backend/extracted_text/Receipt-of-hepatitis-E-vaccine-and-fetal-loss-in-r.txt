The specificity of this risk was underscored vaccine, HEV239, shortly before or during pregnancy and the risk by observations of no increased risk of miscarriage for of miscarriage. We systematically searched PubMed and preprint participants given HEV239 more than the 90 days before platforms for literature containing the terms “hepatitis E pregnancy, and no increased risk of either stillbirth or elective vaccine” or “Hecolin” or “HEV239”, combined with “pregnancy” termination for women administered HEV239 either before or and “fetal loss”, until Oct 6, 2023. Previous research on HEV239 during pregnancy. These findings came from a population with and the risk of miscarriage was limited to just two studies a very low rate (<2%) of elective termination and from a study conducted in China. The first, a randomised, controlled, efficacy with a much larger sample of pregnancies evaluable for trial targeting non-pregnant people aged 16–65 years, in which miscarriages than earlier studies. Our findings were further controls received a hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine, reported on strengthened by active weekly surveillance for early pregnancy only 37 women who had inadvertently received HEV239 during detection and comprehensive, biweekly surveillance for pregnancy, none of whom had a miscarriage. However, a high pregnancy outcomes, use of ultrasound assessments to date the proportion of these women (51%) chose elective terminations, start of the majority of detected pregnancies and to document making it impossible to assess the natural outcomes of these all miscarriages, and physician-confirmed diagnoses of most of pregnancies. Furthermore, the study lacked documentation the pregnancy outcomes. Analyses were additionally regarding the specific timing of HEV239 administration in strengthened by control for multiple baseline risk factors for relation to the onset of pregnancy and used unclear methods for pregnancy outcomes and blinding of the data analysts to detection and outcome evaluations of pregnancies.

Additionally, the availability of study, a randomised trial of HEV239 versus human 2 years of post-vaccination surveillance provided an ample papillomavirus vaccine targeting non-pregnant women aged number of subjects in whom vaccines were given long before 18–45 years, found no elevation of the risk of miscarriages in the pregnancy, serving as negative controls for the associations 213 women given HEV239 shortly before or during pregnancy. between vaccination and pregnancy outcomes.

The following principles were followed to expected date, or who expressed uncertainty about the resolve these issues and create a final, locked data file onset date of their last menstrual period (LMP), was before data analysis. First, outcome diagnoses made by tested for pregnancy with a urine strip hCG rapid test kit a study physician were deemed more reliable than those (Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, Hangzhou, China) and was in the MCH system, which were made by non-physicians. excluded if the test was positive.11 Second, diagnoses of miscarriage versus stillbirth had to After enrolment, female field workers for the study be consistent with gestational age at the time of the event contacted each study participant weekly by home visit or (see below). Third, if no adverse outcome diagnosis was telephone to detect symptoms compatible with HEV given in the study files, but one was indicated in the infection and to refer suspected cases for diagnostic MCH system files, the latter was accepted (no such cases evaluation.8 These field workers also inquired as to whether were found in the MCH data). Fourth, if the adverse the participant had delayed onset of menstruation outcome in the study file was not sufficiently specific exceeding 2 weeks beyond the expected date and referred (eg, “abortion”), and the diagnosis in the MCH file those with positive histories to a community health clarified the diagnosis (eg, “elective termination”), the research worker (CHRW) working for icddr,b’s MCH latter was accepted.

Furthermore, the Matlab surveillance revealed A second possible limitation is that we used Hepa-B similar risks of miscarriage during the 5 years before the rather than a true placebo as the control. However, we trial in villages assigned to the HEV239 group know of no evidence that Hepa-B exerts a protective (768 miscarriages [10·2%] out of 7522 pregnancies) effect against miscarriage when given during pregnancy and villages assigned to the control group or in the 90 days before pregnancy (the proximal period), (768 miscarriages [9·7%] out of 7932 pregnancies; but not during the period preceding the 90 days before RR 1·05 [0·95–1·15], p=0·29). Furthermore, there was no pregnancy onset (distal period), both of which would be elevation of risk of miscarriage in HEV239 vaccinees needed to explain our findings in the absence of an during the distal period, when any relationship between effect of HEV239.
