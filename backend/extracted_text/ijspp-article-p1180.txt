However, how the physical performance benefits of caffeinesupplementationaretranslatedintobetterspecificactionsinintermittentsportsduringrealorsimulatedcompetitionhas beenthetopicoffewerinvestigations,andtheirresultsneedtobeappropriatelyreviewedandmeta-analyzed.Objective:Theaim ofthestudywastoinvestigatetheeffects ofacute caffeine intakeonspecificactions inintermittent sportsinvolvingdecision making and high-intensity efforts (eg, team, racket, and combat sports) during real or simulated competitions. Methods: All studiesincludedhadblindedandcrossoverexperimentaldesigns,andweconductedarisk-of-biasanalysis.Intotal,weincluded 24studies.Ameta-analysiswasperformedusingtherandom-effectsmodeltocalculatethestandardizedmeandifference(SMD) estimated by Hedges g and 95% CIs. Results: Caffeine ingestion increased high-intensity sport-specific actions during competition, such as the number of sprints (SMD: 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23–0.74), body impacts (SMD: 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08– 0.49), accelerations (SMD: 0.35; 95% CI, 0.06–0.63), decelerations (SMD: 0.63; 95% CI, 0.12–1.14), and high-intensity offensiveefforts(SMD:0.36;95%CI,0.11–0.61).Additionally,caffeineingestioninducedahigherpositiveorsuccessrateof actionsduringrealorsimulatedcompetition(SMD:0.44;95%CI,0.19–0.69).Conclusion:Thecurrentmeta-analysisprovides evidenceofcaffeinesupplementationinincreasinghigh-intensityeffortsandthesuccessrateofsport-specificactionsduringreal or simulated competition.
