Review Risk estimation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: considerations for appropriate risk prediction model selection Kim Robin van Daalen*, Dudan Zhang*, Stephen Kaptoge, Ellie Paige, Emanuele Di Angelantonio, Lisa Pennells Cardiovascular diseases remain the number one cause of death globally. Cardiovascular disease risk scores are an Lancet Glob Health 2024; integral tool in primary prevention, being used to identify individuals at the highest risk and guide the assignment of 12: e1343–58 preventive interventions. Available risk scores differ substantially in terms of the population sample data sources *Joint first authors used for their derivation and, consequently, in the absolute risks they assign to individuals. Differences in British Heart Foundation cardiovascular disease epidemiology between the populations contributing to the development of risk scores, and the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, Department of Public target populations in which they are applied, can result in overestimation or underestimation of cardiovascular Health and Primary Care disease risks for individuals, and poorly informed clinical decisions. Given the wide plethora of cardiovascular disease (K R van Daalen PhD, risk scores available, identification of an appropriate risk score for a target population can be challenging. This Review D Zhang PhD, S Kaptoge PhD, provides an up-to-date overview of guideline-recommended cardiovascular disease risk scores from global, regional, Prof E Di Angelantonio MD FMedSci, L Pennells PhD), and national contexts, evaluates their comparative characteristics and qualities, and provides guidance on selection of Victor Phillip Dahdaleh Heart an appropriate risk score. and Lung Research Institute (K R van Daalen, D Zhang, Introduction differences between them, and select the most S Kaptoge, Prof E Di Angelantonio, Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of appropriate risk score for their target population.

Risk scores based on a combination of risk disease risk scores often result in a similar ranking of School of Public Health, factors are more accurate at predicting cardiovascular individuals based on their estimated risk.10,19 However, University of Queensland, disease risk than those that assess risk based on population average risks might differ for several reasons, Brisbane, QLD, Australia (E Paige); Epidemiology and individual risk factors alone.4,5 A plethora of cardiovascular yet are often built into risk scores at development, leading Population Health, The disease risk scores have been developed and updated to variation in risk estimates obtained across different Australian National University, over the past five decades (eg, Framingham,6 Pooled risk scores, for a given set of measured risk factor values.19 Canberra, ACT, Australia Cohort Equations [PCE],7 Systematic Coronary Risk Such variation might reflect the number of endpoints (E Paige); Health Data Science Research Centre, Human Evaluation [SCORE],8 SCORE2,9 WHO cardiovascular included in the cardiovascular disease definition, as well Technopole, Milan, Italy disease risk,10 PREDICT,11 QRISK3,12 and Predicting Risk as the overall underlying risk of the population (data (Prof E Di Angelantonio) of Cardiovascular Disease Events [PREVENT]13,14).15 source) used to derive the risk prediction model.

Are the characteristics of individuals in the derivation sample sufficiently aligned with those of the target population for risk assessment to allow transferability of estimated risk ratios (eg, age range, previous disease status)? Risk factors Are the relevant risk factors included? Inclusion of major lifestyle risk factors (eg, smoking, blood pressure, and BMI or cholesterol) should be a minimum. Are the included risk factors accurately measured in sufficient numbers in the derivation sample? For example, use of continuous blood pressure is more accurate than classification of hypertension based on measured values or self-reported history. Can all risk factors be feasibly measured and are alternative formats available for resource-constrained settings? For example, risk scores using risk factors that do not require laboratory measurements might be more feasible in some settings. Endpoints Does the risk score predict the relevant endpoint (eg, overall cardiovascular disease, stroke, coronary heart disease)? Is endpoint collection in the derivation sample systematic and well validated? Follow-up Is the follow-up time in the derivation sample sufficient to allow risk estimation over the timeframe of interest (usually 10 years)? Statistical model Are appropriate statistical models used for the type of risk estimation? Are relevant assumptions tested (eg, proportional hazards assumption)? Internal validation Discrimination—is the model able to predict order of cardiovascular disease events among individuals? Calibration—is there good agreement between predicted and observed incidence (absolute risk). Has the model been checked for overfitting and optimism in performance? Overfitting is particularly relevant for smaller sample sizes and can be checked by cross-validation or shrinkage. Reclassification—is there appropriate movement of individuals through relevant risk categories when compared with alternative risk models? External validation Transferability Is the model proven to be transferable to the target population in which the score is being used? For example, does the model have a good predictive performance (eg, discrimination and calibration) when applied to new target individuals from a data source that was not used in the model development? Recalibrated Has the model been appropriately recalibrated for use in the target population? Recalibration data Are the data used for recalibration appropriate? For example, do the recalibration data share the same characteristics as the target population? Recalibration Is there a methodological framework proposed or provided for future recalibration in response to changing trends with time as well as divergent cardiovascular disease methods rates across regions and populations? For example, is a guide or statistical code provided for recalibration? What is the ease of recalibration? Are a lot of extra resources required? Are additional data needed for recalibration and are they available? Usability Format Is the format appropriate to be used in the population to which the model is applied (eg, online risk calculator, colour-coded charts)? Implementation Guidelines Has the model been recommended for use by relevant guidelines? This can be either national, regional, or global. Health gains* Has the risk score been evaluated for health gains when used to assess cardiovascular disease risk and guide interventions (eg, statins) for high-risk individuals? Has use of the risk score resulted in significant health gains when used? Cost-effectiveness* Has use of the risk prediction model shown to be cost-effective? If of interest, the TRIPOD guidelines can be used for a more detailed checklist for statistical risk prediction modelling. *Cost-effectiveness and health gains of (different) cardiovascular disease risk models in clinical practice are highly dependent on various factors, such as the target population, baseline cardiovascular disease risk, accompanied clinical guidance (eg, statin allocation), the cost of the drugs or other interventions, reimbursement procedures, and implementation of preventive strategies. Assessments of the health gains and cost-effectiveness might also not be available in many countries and should be considered where available.

The latter approaches can provide greater modelling flexibility than has limitations as most first-time cardiovascular disease traditional approaches.44 However, although AI-based events are non-fatal (depending on the target populations prediction models show some advantages for dealing and access to medical facilities). Risk scores predicting with high-dimensional data, large model development only mortality can underestimate the total cardiovascular datasets are needed to reduce the instability of individual disease burden, particularly in populations where case- predictions and ensure the generalisability of the risk fatality is low (eg, younger individuals) and can thereby models (ie, to avoid overfitting). Research shows that, skew treatment recommendations towards older adults.9 without the benefit of a considerable sample size, Thus, predicting fatal outcomes limits the effective different samples from the same overarching population targeting of preventive action to a small population could result in very different models and individual subset. predictions, even when the same model development Lastly, different cardiovascular disease risk scores methods are being used.26,50 Furthermore, there might be might predict somewhat different collections of cardio- barriers to the practical implementation of machine vascular disease endpoints.

When choosing a risk knowledge, thus far, no AI-based cardiovascular disease score, it is important to consider different endpoints, to clinical prediction model has been recommended by choose those most applicable to the target population guidelines for primary cardiovascular disease prevention. and to adjust intervention thresholds accordingly. More TRIPOD and PROBAST provide details on appropriate definitive endpoints requiring admission to hospital analysis methods to ensure minimal bias and good (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) tend to be more applicability of risk models,28,29 and specific TRIPOD-AI51 consistently and accurately captured across populations, and PROBAST-AI guidelines are under development for which can be beneficial if there is a need for score the reporting of clinical prediction models that use recalibration using population statistics. However, regression or machine learning methods.52 focusing on such endpoints could lead to underestimating the broader cardiovascular disease burden. This matter Performance of risk scores: internal and external should be carefully considered when embedding a risk validation score into policy to ensure that the full preventive In general, to assess the performance of a prediction potential is realised. model, three key criteria should be considered in quantitative assessment: the association of predictors with Statistical model used for model development outcomes; adequate discrimination (ie, ability of a model Most cardiovascular disease risk scores have been derived to predict who will have a cardiovascular disease event using survival analysis models, which are appropriate first; eg, using Harrell’s C-index); and adequate calibration to allow for variable observation time and losses to (ie, agreement between predicted and observed risk). participant follow-up within the cohort.

Where sample sizes are smaller, overfitting should www.thelancet.com/lancetgh Vol 12 August 2024 e1351 Review be checked using bootstrapping, cross-validation, and of cardiovascular disease prediction models following shrinkage approaches.53 Where it is of interest to compare contemporary cardiovascular disease incidence rates and different risk scores with alternative risk predictor average risk factor values from the target population inclusion, reclassification assessment might be relevant.54 might be needed to minimise over-prediction and under- Such comparison is of most relevance where there are prediction of cardiovascular disease risk.19 predefined risk categories and individuals in the dataset Different recalibration methods exist, generally falling are representative of the target population for screening into two categories. For both, original risk ratios pertaining to their risk distribution. (coefficients) are retained, but the level of baseline External validation can be applied to check the absolute risk is reset to the target population. The first transferability of the risk score (model risk ratios) to a method, the replacement method,55 involves replacing new, or broader population, completely distinct from the the baseline survival (relating to the average population derivation data source.22,23 This validation should include risk) and mean risk factor values with those of the target assessing how well the model predicts those who population. The second method, the regression method,56 develop cardiovascular disease in the target population. involves splitting the target population into groups (eg, Assessment of calibration is only relevant in an external by predicted risk or age) and regressing the group- dataset if the individuals are truly representative of the specific observed on predicted risks, yielding recalibration target population for screening. However, accurate factors to bring predicted risks in line with those representation might be seldom because cohort studies observed. In the regression method approach, group- commonly represent a past time period and population specific predicted risks are obtained using observed risk subsets. factor values from the target population, entered in the All scores compared in this Review (table 2; table 3) uncalibrated model. have been well internally validated, with C-statistics Traditionally, recalibration using either of these methods suggesting good or acceptable discrimination ability. The has involved using individual participant data from a extent of external validation varies by risk score, how long contemporary representative cohort for the target it has been available, and the ease of calculation in population (eg, when the Framingham coronary heart external datasets. The Framingham risk score,6 PCE,7 disease risk model was recalibrated for Chinese SCORE,8 SCORE2,9 QRISK1,40 QRISK2,31 Prospective populations).57 However, within the last decade, aggregate- Cardiovascular Münster,35,36 the WHO cardiovascular level data have been used to recalibrate models.9,10,31 In this disease risk score,10 Globorisk,31 the INTERHEART approach, annual age group-specific cardiovascular modifiable risk score,32 Reynolds,38,39 China-PAR,37 and disease incidence estimates are extrapolated, providing PREVENT13,14 show evidence of external validation.

Using of calibration is only relevant in a dataset that is truly aggregate-level data for recalibration has some advantages representative of the contemporary target population. over individual data. First, within many countries, Risk scores that have demonstrated calibration in aggregate-level data can be regularly and conveniently representative datasets or are indeed explicitly recalibrated obtained from routinely collected data, avoiding reliance to reflect risk in the target population include SCORE2,8 on costly and time-consuming accrual of individual-level SCORE2-OP,37 the WHO cardiovascular disease risk,10 prospective cohort data. Second, the use of aggregate-level PREDICT,11 and PREVENT.13,14 data can facilitate capturing risk in the entire population, rather than relying on cohort data. Third, although this Recalibration approach assumes that the single snapshot of 1 year can Risk ratios (ie, model coefficients, such as hazard ratios be extrapolated over a 10-year period, this might be a or odds ratios) for established cardiovascular disease risk smaller assumption than the expectation that cohort data factors are generally similar across populations (ie, the collected over a past period of 10 years (or often before) association is similar across studies, countries, and time will be representative of the coming 10 years. Finally, periods).10 Thus, good model discrimination is expected routinely compiled data are often annually updated, in new populations.19 However, models derived using allowing regular, rapid recalibration with changing trends cohort data can overpredict or underpredict risk in a in cardiovascular disease epidemiology. target population either because the cohort(s) represent a The need for recalibration is context specific and past period with outdated event rates or the cohort(s) depends on the current cardiovascular disease incidence have distinct characteristics compared with the target rates in the target population and how similar these are to population (eg, healthy volunteer bias or specific the rates in the dataset used for model derivation.

Recalibration updates (eg, Globorisk,31 WHO cardiovascular disease e1352 www.thelancet.com/lancetgh Vol 12 August 2024 Review risk,10 and SCORE8 and SCORE2-OP33). The success of charts can only convey information for a few risk factors these approaches relies on the quality of the data used for (often five to six are used) and their simplistic presentation recalibration. Data collection and quality vary enormously often involves substantial rounding errors in risk by country, with some countries having well established estimates.61 Online calculators, such as HeartScore, give For more on HeartScore see medical registries and personal identification numbers more accurate estimates, can be easily updated as https://www.heartscore.org/ for all residents (linkable across different registers and necessary, and often provide graphical representation to yielding reliable cardiovascular disease incidence rates), improve communication.8,12,41 Integration of risk whereas others have no medical record centralisation. estimation systems within general practice databases has For countries without internal registry data, relevant been shown to improve the usability of electronic estimates are commonly available from international calculators.61 For example, the integration of PREDICT11 efforts to quantify disease incidence and risk factor values in New Zealand resulted in a four-fold increase in across multiple countries.

Although these The use of cardiovascular disease risk scores varies records might not be fully representative of the general globally, with various barriers to effective implementation population, they can be considered representative of the including: reliance on laboratory measures,21,22 low users of primary care services. A synchronised approach awareness of cardiovascular disease risk scoring, in which models are embedded within general practice inadequate local or national government policy, general software for patient consultations could allow for a physicians fearing oversimplifying risk assessment by constantly evolving and improving risk prediction using prediction rules, concerns of overuse of medical system. This approach can further support the therapy, poor patient compliance to recommended monitoring of risk score usage, monitoring population treatments, time restrictions, a belief that numerical risk observed and predicted risk distributions, assessing estimates are not helpful for clinical decision making, score calibration, and facilitating score recalibration. and the presence of competing algorithms.63,64 An Some aspects of this approach have been used in the UK integrated approach is needed to ensure optimal (QResearch database40) and New Zealand (PREDICT application and cardiovascular disease prevention, with database11), although risk distribution and recalibration clear locally relevant clinical guidelines, provision of component monitoring have not explicitly been included effective estimation and communication tools, and in either country.
