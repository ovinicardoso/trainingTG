Results: Nine participants (four from 3 h group and five from the immediate group) withdrew from the study. Therefore, 31 participants completed the study. All measures of skeletal muscle mass, Australian pull-up, and muscle strength, significantly increased post-intervention in both groups (p < 0.05). The biochemical marker urea also significantly increased from pre to post in both groups (p < 0.05). There were no significant between-group differences (p > 0.05). Conclusion: High-protein diet enhances muscular performance and skeletal muscle mass in resistance-trained males, irrespective of intake time. Consequently, the total daily protein intake appears to be the primary factor in facilitating muscle growth induced by exercise. KEYWORDS exercise, dietary protein, nutrition, muscle hypertrophy, strength Frontiers in Nutrition 01 frontiersin.org Lak et al. 10.3389/fnut.2024.1397090 Introduction compared to the immediate intake of protein before and after a resistance training session. By examining the differences between For individuals looking to optimize improvements in muscle these timing strategies, we hope to provide empirical insights into the hypertrophy and strength, participation in a resistance training most effective approach for optimizing muscle growth, recovery, and program in conjunction with adequate dietary protein intake is body composition in this population. Such insights are crucial for necessary (1, 2). Key variables in resistance training that are often refining dietary protein intake in conjunction with resistance training manipulated to maximize muscle hypertrophy include training protocols, thereby optimizing the training adaptations of dedicated volume, intensity, and frequency (3). Similarly, there also exists dietary male athletes striving to achieve their peak potential. protein intake variables to maximize training adaptations, which include total daily protein intakes, within-day protein distribution Methods (relationship between the quantities of dietary protein consumed meal to meal to the overall intake), and the timing of protein intake relative Participants to the resistance exercise stimulus (i.e., protein timing) (4, 5). Relative to total daily protein intakes, higher protein intakes are superior to lower protein intakes (1, 6–8). A threshold for total daily Forty resistance-trained males (24 ± 4 years) were recruited for protein intake has been reported to be approximately 1.6 g kg−1 d−1 for this study from November 2022 to March 2023, following their individuals looking to improve hypertrophy outcomes (1, 6, 9). presentation at our physical and sports medicine office. Before the Protein intakes surpassing this threshold are not likely to provide initial assessment, nine individuals dropped out for personal reasons. further benefit relative to gains in skeletal muscle mass (SMM) or The inclusion criteria comprised performing resistance training at strength (10, 11). The distribution of dietary protein intake throughout least three times a week for 1 year prior to the start of the study, not the day also represents an important consideration for optimizing taking any steroids or supplements for at least 1 year prior to the start protein intake in resistance-trained athletes. Prior work in this area of the study, having no proven medical issues or musculoskeletal has reported consuming a balanced distribution of protein throughout disorders, abstaining from alcohol and tobacco, sleeping for at least the day, consisting of 4–5 evenly spaced feedings to be optimal for seven to 8 h during the 24 h day, and having a protein intake lower maximizing post-prandial muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates and than ~2 g kg−1 d−1. Possible participants were excluded from muscle hypertrophy outcomes (12, 13). participating through failure to meet any of the previously stated While there appears to be a consensus with respect to total daily criteria. Additional exclusions were non-willingness to continue protein intakes and the distribution of that protein to optimize skeletal protein intake or performing exercise protocols, participation in other muscle hypertrophy adaptations to resistance training, the effect of the additional exercises than the prescribed resistance training program, timing of protein intake around exercise on hypertrophy outcomes consumption of dietary supplements (other than the protein remains unclear, with some research reporting improvements in intervention) during the study period, and missing more than one muscle hypertrophy with protein timing and others concluding no training session or protein intake throughout the study. A physician hypertrophic benefits associated with protein timing. In particular, using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) and previous work has found notable improvements in muscle size, lean medical health/history questionnaire conducted the eligibility mass, and strength when protein is consumed within a specific assessment. Participants deemed eligible provided written and verbal window of time before and/or after a bout of resistance training in consent. All protocols were approved by the institutional review board younger, trained individuals (14). However, other studies conducted of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, in similar populations have found little to no effect of protein timing carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and (15). There have also been two systematic reviews and meta-analyses registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05544955). on protein timing, with both reporting no beneficial effect of a specific timing of protein intake on muscle hypertrophy (16, 17). However, the Study design majority of studies included in previous systematic reviews and meta- analyses assessing the impact of protein timing on changes in muscle size and strength had an inactive comparator design (i.e., while the This investigation constituted a randomized clinical trial intervention group was given a protein supplement before and/or after employing convenience sampling methodology. The randomization exercise, the control group was not provided a comparable dose of was conducted through the block randomization method, based on a protein at any point during the intervention). Stated differently, most 1:1 equation. A matched-pair design was used to facilitate the studies included in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of protein allocation of participants into experimental groups. Initially, timing lacked a control group with matched protein type, dose, and participants were ranked according to their SMM, arranged from frequency, thereby limiting the conclusions drawn about protein highest to lowest. Subsequently, the ABBA assignment procedure was timing. This is a major weakness in this body of research that needs to applied for group allocation.

Through a This alternating assignment pattern ensures a balanced distribution, randomized clinical trial, we seek to investigate the contrasting where for each sequential pair of participants (1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and impacts of protein intake 3 h before and three hours after exercise, 6, etc.), both groups receive alternately either the higher or lower Frontiers in Nutrition 02 frontiersin.org Lak et al. 10.3389/fnut.2024.1397090 SMM score within each pair, thus maintaining an equitable group bioelectrical impedance approach has good test-retest reliability composition (18).

The participants’ body mass was assessed using a Performance testing digital scale manufactured by Lumbar in China, with measurements recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height measurements were obtained using a stadiometer produced by Race Industrialization in China. The The assessment included measuring the maximum height study used a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance equipment, achieved during the vertical jump and the total number of Australian namely the Inbody 770 from South Korea, to assess several body pull-ups completed in a single set. Typically, every participant engaged composition parameters including SMM, fat mass (FM), and body in a warm-up routine that included a 5 min run or bike session on a mass index (BMI). Prior to the measurement, the palms and soles of treadmill or cycle ergometer, performed at a self-determined leisurely the participants were cleansed using an electrolyte tissue. The intensity. This was followed by a dynamic warm-up comprising participants then positioned themselves on the InBody 770 device, 10-yard repetitions of high knees, butt kicks, side shuffles, and karaoke ensuring that the soles of their feet were in contact with the running drills. Finally, the warm-up concluded with 10 repetitions of electrodes. The instrument obtained the body mass of the pushups and 10 repetitions of bodyweight squats. The participants participants, while the researcher manually entered their age and sex thereafter engaged in a period of rest lasting 3–5 min before starting into the display.

Frontiers in Nutrition 07 frontiersin.org Lak et al. 10.3389/fnut.2024.1397090 between the two protein timing groups revealed no significant differences in muscular performance or body composition parameters; both groups equally improved SMM and muscular performance. This improvement highlights that the training paradigm was successful in enhancing performance and body composition variables for both groups, underlining that both groups did successfully undergo a training program. These findings suggest that protein timing may not have effects on indices such as muscular performance and body composition. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the most up-to-date evidence on the impact of protein timing supplementation on muscle performance and body composition.
