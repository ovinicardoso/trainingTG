Unpublished incidence estimates among women who engage in sex work and person-years of follow-up were obtained through personal communications with study authors. IRR=incidence rate ratio. *Area used to match women who engage in sex work incidence to total female population incidence estimates to calculate IRRs. †Age group used to match women who engage in sex work incidence to total female population incidence estimates; when no age information was specified, a default of age 15–39 years was used. ‡Incidence matched to women who engage in sex work estimate by subnational location, midpoint year, and age group. §IRR calculated by dividing study-reported women who engage in sex work incidence by area–year matched total population female incidence. Total population female incidence in 2022 was extracted from Naomi, the UNAIDS-supported district-level estimation model,22 and extrapolated parallel to national-level female HIV incidence trajectories from UNAIDS Global HIV Estimates 2022, National Spectrum estimates.23,24 ¶Incidence estimate were derived from serial cross-sectional prevalence testing with no estimate of person-years or number of new infections. The number of person-years was imputed using the median number of person-years across all studies and split proportionally according to the denominator in each age group. Imputed person-year values were then multiplied by the study-reported HIV incidence to back-calculate the number of HIV infections. ||Incidence estimate derived from recent HIV infection testing. The number of person-years was derived by multiplying the number of tested individuals by 0·5. Table 1: Annual incidence estimates for women who engage in sex work and women from the general population matched for area, year, and age predominantly from Kenya and Zimbabwe (49 [59%] women who engage in sex work or stratified by gender of 83). In western and central Africa, 18 incidence identity. Six study populations were women linked to estimates were reported from eight countries. Median clinics or sex worker programmes. Study reach varied study year was 2008 (IQR 2000–15). Between 1985 and widely, from studies in single clinics to single towns, 2020, 2194 new HIV infections were observed from cities, or regions, and multiple locations nationally in 51 490 person years with median HIV incidence of South Africa and Zimbabwe. Recruitment methods 4·3 per 100 person years (IQR 2·8–7·0 per 100 person included network sampling approaches (seven studies), years; eastern and southern Africa: 4·3 per 100 person time location sampling (four), clinic recruitment (seven), years [2·9–6·3]; western and central Africa: 3·8 per or convenience samples from peer outreach activities 100 person years [2·2–7·5]). or community meetings (nine). Study participant ages 19 of 32 studies were cohort studies, seven were ranged from a median of 15 years (IQR 14–17)27 to a mean randomised control trials or intervention studies, of 38 years (30–45),93 with 11 (34%) studies reporting five were cross-sectional studies, and one used routine mean or median ages between 25 and 30 years.

Four studies estimated incidence from recency assays, and one used back calculation from age-specific HIV prevalence. Assessment with the GHQAT classified 17 studies as good quality and the remaining 15 as fair (appendix 2 p 10). Studies all scored well in terms of study design, with 20·00 study objectives and study populations clearly defined. 26 studies either had robust approaches to sampling or did not seek to generalise their findings beyond their study population so were considered adequately 2·00 representative. Power calculations were presented in nine studies. Scores for study implementation varied, with ten studies reporting participation rates, of which six reported over 85% participation. For 19 studies, it was 0·20 likely that participants enrolled were representative of the source population. Scoring for measurement of HIV 0·20 2·00 20·00 incidence was variable. Among longitudinal studies, 12 report over 70% participant retention at 12 months or study endpoint and 15 assessed reasons for dropout or Figure 2: Empirical estimates of HIV Incidence among women who engage in sex work described methods to address loss to follow-up.

among women who engage in sex work.93 Despite higher relative incidence in western and central Africa, median incidence was modestly lower 100 than in studies in eastern and southern Africa. HIV transmission in western and central Africa tends to be more concentrated among key populations such as women who engage in sex work, resulting in larger 10 incidence differences with the total population.94 The declining HIV incidence among women who engage in sex work observed in this analysis was consistent with mathematical modelling studies from 1 western and central Africa that estimate the proportion of total new HIV infections attributable to commercial sex has fallen over time.95,96 These parallel declines contrast HIV incidence trends among men who have sex with men in sub-Saharan Africa for whom a recent 1990 2000 2010 2020 systematic review found no evidence of incidence Year decline.97 Initial reductions in incidence in women who Figure 4: HIV IRRs modelled over time, presented on the logarithmic scale engage in sex work probably resulted from imple- Points represent IRRs calculated by dividing study-reported HIV incidence in mentation of sex worker dedicated prevention WESW by age–district–year matched total population HIV incidence derived programmes and health services in sub-Saharan Africa.5 from the Naomi model.22 The solid line represents the estimated IRR for More recently, declines might reflect the effect of HIV sub-Saharan Africa, with the grey shading capturing the 95% uncertainty range.
