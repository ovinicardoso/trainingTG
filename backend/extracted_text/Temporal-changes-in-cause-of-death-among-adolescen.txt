Results from p 21). e1281 www.thelancet.com/lancetgh Vol 12 August 2024 Articles Among adolescent girls, the percentage of deaths attributed to communicable diseases ranged from 26·0% (95% CrI 12·2–42·5) in Nairobi to 55·7% (44·8–65·2) in uMkhanyakude. For most HDSS sites, communicable diseases were mainly attributable to HIV or tuberculosis, meningitis or sepsis, and pneumonia. The CSMF for maternal causes was high in Rakai (20·7% [95% CrI 2·3–57·8]) and Agincourt (14·3% [5·5–25·4]). There was a high percentage of injury-related deaths among men, particularly in Nairobi (87·8%), uMkhanyakude (55·9%), and Kisesa (50·0%). HIV or tuberculosis was among the leading causes of death in adolescent boys in all HDSS sites, with a CSMF of 5·8% (95% CrI 1·3–9·9) in Nairobi and up to 30·2% (21·9–37·3) in uMkhanyakude. In Rakai, although HIV or tuberculosis was less than 2% in the adolescent age group, a high percentage of deaths were attributed to other and unspecified infectious diseases in both adolescents and adults, potentially including HIV/AIDS deaths with inadequate information for more specific classification (appendix 1 pp 24–25). Among adults aged 20–59 years, infectious diseases including HIV and tuberculosis accounted for the highest percentage of deaths in all HDSS sites, with assigned HIV and tuberculosis being the dominant cause of death for women and men, except in Rakai and Manicaland where other or unspecified communicable 800 diseases made up the largest percentage of deaths. Non-communicable diseases generally accounted for 600 a similar or slightly higher percentage of deaths for adults compared with adolescents. In Nairobi, for example, the percentage of deaths assigned to non- 400 communicable disease in all adolescents and adults aged 12 and older in 2010–14 was 29·9% (95% CrI 27·8–32·2), 200 in adolescents it was 10·3% (95% CrI 4·1–17·8), and in adults aged 20–49 it was 25·8% (95% CrI 22·5–29·3). 0 The percentage of deaths attributed to maternal causes 1995–992000–04 2005–09 2010–14 2015–19 was lower in adults than in adolescents. For example, in uMkhanyakude, 2·0% (95% CrI 1·1–3·2) of deaths were attributed to maternal causes among adults compared with 8·7% (3·1–16·2) among adolescents.

For example, in Nairobi, we see and 5 million person-years from six countries in eastern particularly high proportions and rates of injury-related and southern Africa. We found some consistent patterns deaths among adolescent boys, most of which were over time across the different HDSS sites including attributable to assault. Interventions that could be mortality rates decreasing, particularly among adults aged considered to target this burden include programmes 20–59 years. There were also clear age patterns in the addressing high-risk behaviours, such as improving school cause of death distributions with HIV and tuberculosis transition to secondary school, reducing the pronounced being the leading cause for adults and non-communicable school dropout rates,31 preventing substance abuse,32 diseases the leading cause for adults aged 60 years and improving employment opportunities, and enhancement older for the 2010–14 period in most of the HDSS sites. of social and legal infrastructure in the informal We observed some similar and some divergent patterns settlements where the Nairobi study participants live. in changes in cause of death over time. For most Although direct comparison with previous publications HDSS sites, we saw decreases in HIV and tuberculosis is challenging due to differences in age groups and mortality rates among adults, which appeared to explain calendar periods, our results generally align with existing most of the declines in all-cause mortality rates. This estimates in terms of levels and trends in CSMFs from trend has been reported in other studies11,24 and probably the same study areas. For example, in Nairobi, the share reflects the introduction and roll-out of antiretroviral of non-communicable diseases is about 29·9% (95% CrI therapy and broader social and environmental changes 27·8–32·2) for adolescents and adults aged 12 and older during the study period (appendix 1 pp 5–8).25 These for 2010–14 in our study, which is close to the 23% for declines appear to have stalled in the most recent study adults aged 18 and older reported in a previous periods in some HDSS sites, such as Karonga and publication using the same data source and algorithm.24 Kisesa. Elsewhere, despite recent declines, HIV and Compared with a study by Mberu and colleagues,11 also tuberculosis mortality rates remained high (eg, Agincourt using the Nairobi HDSS data for the period 2005–09 but and uMkhanyakude).

The mortality rates were stable in most of the HDSS sites, leading causes of death in Agincourt were the same as which is consistent with Global Burden of Disease previous findings using the InterVA algorithm on the findings for sub-Saharan Africa26 and is probably same HDSS data, specifically, HIV and tuberculosis, explained by the rural location of most of our HDSS sites, pneumonia, and digestive neoplasms were the top three where the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is causes in the early 2010s.25,33 generally lower than in urban areas.27 Verbal autopsy is an inherently imprecise tool: it There were different patterns across the HDSS sites for assigns cause of death on the basis of signs and other causes of deaths. The leading causes of death symptoms reported from proxy respondents recalling among adolescents were non-communicable diseases in details weeks, months, or sometimes even years after the Kisesa, injuries in Nairobi, and communicable diseases death occurred. For causes of death that have distinctive (including HIV and tuberculosis) in all other HDSS sites. symptoms or circumstances (eg, deaths due to assault or The fraction of deaths due to communicable diseases maternal causes) misclassification is less likely, but some were high among adults aged 60 years and older in Rakai communicable and non-communicable diseases have compared with adults aged 15–59 years, but not in the common symptoms and assigning cause of death is other HDSS sites. Trends in maternal mortality rates also challenging. For example, some HIV and tuberculosis varied with some HDSS sites showing little change and deaths could have been classified as unspecified others showing declines over time (notably, in Kisesa, infections, particularly if there were atypical verbal Nairobi, Rakai, and uMkhanyakude).
