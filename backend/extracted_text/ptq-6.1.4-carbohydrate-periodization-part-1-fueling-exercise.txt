CARBOHYDRATE PERIODIZATION—PART 1: FUELING EXERCISE MIKE NELSON, PHD, CSCS, CISSN Exercise training has employed the concept of periodization To fully understand the role of carbohydrates on exercise for decades, but the application of periodization to nutrition performance, the key underlying physiologic components must is a comparatively new concept. This two-part series will be understood first. For instance, as an athlete starts to ramp up look at the effects of carbohydrates on exercise performance. Part to higher and higher exercise intensities, there is a shift in fuel 1 will be an investigation of how providing adequate carbohydrates substrates from fat at lower intensity via aerobic metabolism to positively impacts performance. Part 2 will investigate how the the use of more carbohydrates at higher intensities via increased opposite, specifically timed restriction of carbohydrates, may anaerobic metabolism (30,33). This was first formally coined by enhance performance via different mechanisms. Brooks and Mercier in 1994 as the “crossover effect,” (5). This is a gradual transition as the exercise intensity is increased —more In athletic training, the term “periodization” can be viewed as like a dimmer switch on a light than a hard on/off switch. To add a structured or planned process of training. This can take many more complexity, researchers have shown that even at the same forms for both endurance and resistance exercise from linear moderate to low exercise intensities, different athletes use a volume periodization to more complicated schemes, such as daily different “fuel mix” with some using more fat and others using undulating periodization (DUP). In regards to nutrition, there may more carbohydrates (15,18,27). be less planning particularly regarding how nutrition will match to the training plan on a macro level. The term “periodized nutrition” Another key component is that carbohydrate storage is much was defined by Jeukendrup as “the strategic combined use of more limited compared to fat. Carbohydrates are mainly stored exercise training and nutrition, or nutrition only, with the overall in the body in the form of glycogen in the liver and the muscles aim to obtain adaptations that support exercise performance,” (Table 1). The amount of blood glucose is comparatively tiny, (21). The purpose of this article is not to provide a full literature at less than one teaspoon. Blood glucose in healthy subjects review, but to give an overview and theoretical framework on the is tightly controlled, whereas liver and muscle glycogen can concept of periodized nutrition—with an emphasis on adequate vary widely depending on nutrition, exercise type, and exercise carbohydrate intake to enhance performance. duration performed. CARBOHYDRATES AND EXERCISE TABLE 1. STORED CARBOHYDRATES IN THE Providing carbohydrates in conjunction with exercise is not a LIVER, MUSCLES, AND BLOOD new concept. In 1887, Montague Shearman stated, ‘‘Going into The average 150-lb (68-kg) male has about 1,800 calories of training was taken to mean the commencement of a peculiar diet carbohydrates stored in the liver, muscles, and blood (37). of half-cooked beefsteaks and dry bread and the reduction of the daily drink to a minimum, and not to imply the beginning of the Muscle glycogen 1,400 calories proper training or cultivation of the muscles required for a race,” Liver glycogen 320 calories (26). Early work from Bergström et al. and also Hermansen et al. demonstrated strong associations between muscle glycogen Blood glucose 80 calories depletion and impaired muscle function during exercise at TOTAL 1,800 calories moderate to high intensities in humans (4,19). Fast-forward years later with accumulated data that carbohydrate intake is of great Muscles and the liver play key roles during rest and exercise. The particular importance for acute athletic performance in both liver has the ability to take other substrates such as lactate, amino endurance and resistance training (16,28,31,32,33,35). It should acids, and glycerol (from the breakdown of triglycerides) and be noted here that carbohydrate intake includes carbohydrates convert them into glucose (i.e., gluconeogenesis). This process is consumed before, during, and after high-volume exercise (35). especially critical in times of prolonged fasting or intense exercise. 16 PTQ 6.1 | NSCA.COM For example, the contribution of gluconeogenesis to liver glucose A caveat is that many athletes, especially females, tend to production accounts for almost half of glucose production in under eat despite reporting “best practices” of carbohydrate healthy subjects at the end of a 42-hour fast (1). Muscle glycogen, intake (17). This was supported by data from Masson et al., on the other hand, does not decrease during periods of fasting, where many non-eliete endurance athletes did not meet the unless direct muscular work is performed (14,34,36). curent recommendations for carbohydrates (25). Baranauskas et al. found that 81% of endurance athletes consumed lower NO CARBOHYDRATES AND PERFORMANCE EFFECTS than recommended amounts of carbohydrates in their diet (2). It seems logical to assume that since carbohydrates enhance Specially, female athletes were low in carbohydrates, dietary exercise performance especially as the intensity is increased, fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and micronutrients (2). While then the opposite condition would be true where the removal carbohydrate intake is important for exercise performance and of carbohydrates as a fuel should then severely reduce exercise is typically low, close adherence to total caloric intake must performance. To that end, studies where glycogen depletion was still be examined. undertaken and then further work was performed do show that performance declined (4,19). The downside of glycogen depletion CARBOHYDRATE AMOUNTS DURING EXERCISE CARBOHYDRATE PERIODIZATION—PART 1: FUELING EXERCISE studies is the massive amount of muscular work or very high Once a baseline of carbohydrates are established, if prolonged intensity of exercise that is needed to be performed to deplete (greater than 60 – 120 min) exercise is to be performed, the glycogen, which imparts a high level of fatigue before the next addition of carbohydrates during exercise has been shown exercise session is performed. to enhance performance (8,16,23,28,32,35). A recent study investigated the maximal ergogenic (performance enhancing) Because of the flaw of accumulated fatigue in depletion studies, is amount of carbohydrates required during a simulated race (time there another line of data where glycogen is either not present or trial) (24). Ten trained (average VO2max of 61.2 ml/kg/min) males its use is impaired that could provide insights? McArdle’s disease took part in a double-blind, randomized trial over five occasions is a rare genetic disorder where the glycogen phosphorylase at 77% VO₂max for two hours, followed by a 30-min time-trial that breaks down glycogen into glucose subunits to be used as (TT). During the time trial portion, they ingested five different fuel, is missing (12). When these subjects with McArdle’s disease types of carbohydrates of varying amounts/types ranging 60 to are tested at higher exercise intensities, massive impairments in 112.5 g/hour. They concluded that 90 g/hr of a 50/50 mixture exercise performance and higher than normal muscular pain are of glucose and fructose was best for cycling TT performance. reported (13). In this worst-case scenario when carbohydrates A meta-analysis conducted by Pöchmüller M et al. in 2014 of 16 cannot be effectively used as fuel, exercise performance is randomized controlled trials on trained cyclists (mean VO2max severely impaired. between 50 – 71 ml/kg bodyweight/min) found a benefit to ingesting carbohydrates in a concentration range of 6 – 8% just HOW MANY CARBOHYDRATES? before and/or while exercising longer than 90 min (28). Thus, providing data that the amount and concentration do, in fact, Once it has been established that carbohydrates are essential matter. The American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, for more intense exercise, the next logical question is, how much and the American College of Sports Medicine recommended carbohydrates are needed? The early work in this area was done that for endurance events up to 1 – 2.5 hr fueling during the over five decades ago with the invention of the needle biopsy race with carbohydrates at 60 g/hr and for races over 2.5 hours technique that allowed a sample of fresh muscle tissue to be going up to 90 g/hr (16,29,35). A potential downside is the risk extracted and analyzed for glycogen content (3). This spurred of gastrointestinal distress increases sharply at around 60 g/hr, further research into the concept of glycogen supercompensation especially when only single-carbohydrate sources are ingested. that typically employed very high levels of exercise and intensity This effect may be mode dependent as running and strength in conjunction with various amounts of carbohydrates during the exercises result in increased intra-abdominal pressure and organs week leading up to an endurance event. A landmark study in the bouncing that exasperate (GI) issues (9,11,22). early 1980s found similar magnitudes of performance increases, but employed a much less severe protocol since it did not involve the exhaustive exercise and carbohydrate restriction phase (31). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Sherman et al. found a carbohydrate intake of 5 g/kg of body In summary, carbohydrates are an effective ergogenic aid for mass for several days followed up by an even higher intake at 8 g/ endurance exercise performance, especially as the length of kg body mass for three days produced similar effects compared exercise time increases. A baseline daily nutrition intake of around to the more extreme glycogen supercompensation methods 5 – 8 g/kg/day or up to 7 – 12 g/kg/day in the most extreme cases originally performed (20,31). More recent work from Burke et al. appears to be sufficient. Consumption of carbohydrates during has recommended carbohydrate intake ranges of 5 – 7 g/kg/day longer exercise bouts may also be ergogenic with amounts up to for general training needs and 7 – 12 g/kg/day for the increased 90 g/hour during cycling performance using a mixture of glucose needs of endurance athletes when performing intense physical and fructose being beneficial. These guidelines need to be tested exercise of 2 – 3 hours daily (6,7). This was found to be similar to in practice with each athlete as the amounts may be different, that recommended by the International Society of Sports Nutrition especially in endurance exercises, such as running, where GI issues (ISSN) who recommend athletes and active individuals consume are more common. a diet high in carbohydrates of 5 – 8 g/kg/day to maintain muscle and liver carbohydrate stores (23).
